Q1)771. Jewels and Stones
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
Example 1:
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Sol)
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int:
        counter = 0
        jewels = set(J) # search in a set is instant - O(1)
        for stone in S:
            if stone in jewels:
                counter += 1
        return counter
Q2)1678. Goal Parser Interpretation
You own a Goal Parser that can interpret a string command. The command consists of an alphabet of "G", "()" and/or "(al)" in some order. The Goal Parser will interpret "G" as the string "G", "()" as the string "o", and "(al)" as the string "al". The interpreted strings are then concatenated in the original order.
Given the string command, return the Goal Parser's interpretation of command.
Example 1:
Input: command = "G()(al)"
Output: "Goal"
Explanation: The Goal Parser interprets the command as follows:
G -> G
() -> o
(al) -> al
The final concatenated result is "Goal".
Sol)
class Solution:
    def interpret(self,s):
        mapped = {'G':'G','()':'o','(al)':'al'}
        tmp = ''
        res = ''
        for i in s:
            tmp += i
            if tmp in mapped:
                res += mapped[tmp]
                tmp = ''
        return res
Q3)2194. Cells in a Range on an Excel Sheet
A cell (r, c) of an excel sheet is represented as a string "<col><row>" where:
<col> denotes the column number c of the cell. It is represented by alphabetical letters.
For example, the 1st column is denoted by 'A', the 2nd by 'B', the 3rd by 'C', and so on.
<row> is the row number r of the cell. The rth row is represented by the integer r.
You are given a string s in the format "<col1><row1>:<col2><row2>", where <col1> represents the column c1, <row1> represents the row r1, <col2> represents the column c2, and <row2> represents the row r2, such that r1 <= r2 and c1 <= c2.
Return the list of cells (x, y) such that r1 <= x <= r2 and c1 <= y <= c2. The cells should be represented as strings in the format mentioned above and be sorted in non-decreasing order first by columns and then by rows.
Example 1:
Input: s = "K1:L2"
Output: ["K1","K2","L1","L2"]
Explanation:
The above diagram shows the cells which should be present in the list.
The red arrows denote the order in which the cells should be presented.
Sol)
class Solution:
    def cellsInRange(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        
        fr=int(s[1])
        sr=int(s[4])+1
        l=[]
        
       
        for ch in range(ord(s[0]), ord(s[3])+1):
            for i in range(fr, sr):
                l.append(chr(ch)+str(i))
        return l
Q4)1221. Split a String in Balanced Strings
Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.
Given a balanced string s, split it into some number of substrings such that:
Each substring is balanced.
Return the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.
Example 1:
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
Sol)
class Solution(object):
    def balancedStringSplit(self, s):
        w_count = l_count = r_count = 0
        for ch in s:
            if ch == "L":
                l_count += 1
            else:
                r_count += 1
            if l_count == r_count:
                w_count += 1
        return w_count
Q5)1859. Sorting the Sentence
A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.
A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.
For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as "sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".
Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.
Example 1:
Input: s = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3"
Output: "This is a sentence"
Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions "This1 is2 a3 sentence4", then remove the numbers.
Sol)
class Solution:
    def sortSentence(self, s: str) -> str:
        word_list = s.split()  
        n = len(word_list)
        index_dict = dict()
        for word in word_list:
            index_dict[int(word[-1])] = word[:-1]
            res = ""
            for i in range(1, n+1):
                res += index_dict.get(i,'')
                res += " "
        return res.rstrip()  # right strip as " " is present at the end of the sentence
