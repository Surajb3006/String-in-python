Q1)771. Jewels and Stones
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
Example 1:
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int:
        counter = 0
        jewels = set(J) # search in a set is instant - O(1)
        for stone in S:
            if stone in jewels:
                counter += 1
        return counter

    def interpret(self,s):
        mapped = {'G':'G','()':'o','(al)':'al'}
        tmp = ''
        res = ''
        for i in s:
            tmp += i
            if tmp in mapped:
                res += mapped[tmp]
                tmp = ''
        return res
